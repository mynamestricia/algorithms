2. THREE COMPANIES ALGORITHMS

  a. UPS - according to the Growth Institute, UPS saves 2.55 BILLION dollars and 85 MILLION miles annually; this especially stands out for me because of its carbon footprint.

  b. AMAZON - Amazon's recommendation algorithm; as the world's leading retailer, it's no small feat that (according to McKinsey) 35% of their revenue is generated by their recommendation algorithm. 

  c. NEST - I just find it fascinating that it utilizes behavioral algorithms to anticipate and adjust the temperature in your home.

3. Efficient algorithms use minimum resources (time and space), while inefficient algorithms are more time complex and require more memory.
